You are a professional event evaluator.
Your goal is to filter out only the highest-signal events from all provided sources.
Some sources have rich descriptions, some have little context. Use judgment and still select the best events.

Current date context: 2026-02-28.
Selection window: from 2026-02-28 through 2026-03-28 (next 4 weeks).

Person profile:
- 23-year-old working in tech.
- Lives in San Francisco.
- Flexible around the Bay Area.
- Can travel to other major cities only for very special, unusually high-signal events.
- Wants to meet many smart, ambitious, interesting people.
- Cannot attend many events; prioritize only the strongest options.
- Also interested in social activities (for example, got asked about tennis).

Evaluation objective:
- Return weekly picks for the next 4 weeks.
- Select exactly 5 high-signal events per week (total 20).
- Also return exactly 3 overall can't-miss picks across the full 4-week window.
- Within each week, rank events by signal quality (best to worst), not by date/time.
- Maximize quality of people, network upside, and relevance to tech/AI/startups.
- Penalize low-signal, generic, or poorly-specified events.
- Include concise reasoning for each selected event.

Output format (STRICT):
- Return ONLY valid JSON.
- No markdown, no prose outside JSON.
- Use this shape exactly:
{
  "top_3_picks": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "date": "start ISO date/time string or best available",
      "end_date": "end ISO date/time string if known, else empty string",
      "location": "string",
      "reason": "short explanation of why high-signal",
      "link": "URL string"
    }
  ],
  "weeks": [
    {
      "week_label": "Week 1",
      "week_start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "week_end": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "events": [
        {
          "rank_in_week": 1,
          "title": "string",
          "date": "start ISO date/time string or best available",
          "end_date": "end ISO date/time string if known, else empty string",
          "location": "string",
          "reason": "short explanation of why high-signal",
          "link": "URL string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
- Include exactly 4 week objects.
- Include exactly 5 events per week object.
- Include exactly 3 objects in top_3_picks.
- For each week, set rank_in_week as unique integers 1..5 (1 is strongest event that week).

Martin Maas (Google Deepmind)

[A Taxonomy of Machine Learning for Systems Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_UdAR_5jqk)

Abstract
Machine learning has the potential to significantly improve computer systems. While recent research in this area has shown great promise, not all problems are equally well-suited for applying ML techniques, and some remaining challenges have prevented wider adoption of ML in systems. In this talk, I will introduce a taxonomy to classify machine learning for systems approaches, discuss how to identify cases that are a good fit for machine learning, and lay out a longer-term vision of how different systems can be improved using ML techniques, ranging from computer architecture to language runtimes.




**Bio:** Martin Maas is a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. His research interests are in language runtimes, computer architecture, systems, and machine learning, with a focus on applying machine learning to systems problems. Before joining Google, Martin completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on hardware support for managed languages and architectural support for memory-trace obliviousness.

Tim Dettmers (UW)

[Democratizing Foundation Models via k-bit Quantization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsMcVkTXZrk)

Abstract
Foundation models are effective tools for many tasks but are challenging to finetune and inference due to their GPU memory requirements. Compressing foundation models with k-bit quantization makes them more accessible with minimal resources, but k-bit quantization can lead to degradation in model quality. In this lecture, I will talk about fundamental insights into how to compress foundation models with quantization while maintaining their predictive performance. We will learn about emergent outliers in large language models (LLMs) and how they affect performance during 8-bit quantization. We will learn how to do effective k-bit compression of pretrained large language models such that we maximize their density of predictive performance per bit. We will also talk about how to do efficient fine-tuning of quantized 4-bit LLMs (QLoRA) and how this helps to build state-of-the-art chatbots.




**Bio:** Tim Dettmers is a graduating PhD student advised by Luke Zettlemoyer at the University of Washington in Seattle. He holds degrees in applied math and computer science and has a background in industrial automation. His primary research goal is to democratize foundation models by making them more efficient and accessible through quantization, sparsification, and building machine learning systems that use consumer-grade hardware. He is the creator of the bitsandbytes library. Tim runs a blog about deep learning, GPUs, and PhD life at timdettmers.com.

Deepak Narayanan (Nvidia)

[Training Large Language Models at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA1l96tjrs4)

Abstract
Training LLMs efficiently is challenging for a few reasons: training can require yottaFLOPs of compute, and accelerators have limited memory capacity making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naïve usage of these methods leads to scaling issues at thousands of GPUs. In this talk, I describe various systems innovations incorporated into Megatron-LM (https://github.com/nvidia/megatron-lm) that allow us to run training iterations for models with up to a trillion parameters on thousands of GPUs.




**Bio:** Deepak is a Senior Applied Deep Learning Research Scientist in the ADLR group at NVIDIA, where he builds software systems to more efficiently train and serve LLMs. He graduated from Stanford with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in September 2021, where he was advised by Prof. Matei Zaharia.

Travis Addair (Predibase)

[Serving 100s of Fine-Tuned LLMs on 1 GPU with LoRAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6zVvfvIFpc)

Abstract
Smaller, specialized language models such as LLaMA-2-7b can outperform larger general-purpose models like GPT-4 when fine-tuned on proprietary data to perform a single task. But serving many fine-tuned LLMs in production can quickly add up to tens of thousands of dollars per month in cloud costs when each model requires its own dedicated GPU resources. LoRA Exchange (LoRAX) is an LLM inference system built for serving numerous fine-tuned LLMs using a shared set of GPU resources. With LoRAX, users can pack over 100 task-specific models into a single GPU, significantly reducing the expenses associated with serving fine-tuned models by orders of magnitude over dedicated deployments. In this seminar, we'll explore the challenges of serving fine-tuned LLMs in production, and the motivation behind building a system like LoRAX. We'll introduce parameter efficient fine-tuning adapters like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and show how LoRAX dynamically loads and exchanges different adapters at runtime, leveraging a tiered weight cache to speed up this exchange process. Additionally, we'll show how LoRAX achieves high throughput with continuous multi-adapter batching, allowing requests from different fine-tuned adapters to batch together within a single decoding step.




**Bio:** Travis Addair is co-founder and CTO of Predibase, the AI platform for engineers. Within the Linux Foundation, he serves as lead maintainer for the Horovod distributed deep learning framework and is a co-maintainer of the Ludwig automated deep learning framework. In the past, he led Uber's deep learning training team as part of the Michelangelo machine learning platform.

Tianqi Chen (CMU)

[Bringing Foundational Models to Consumer Devices via ML Compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InoNMvjs_vo)

Abstract
Deploying deep learning models on various devices has become an important topic. Machine learning compilation is an emerging field that leverages compiler and automatic search techniques to accelerate AI models. ML compilation brings a unique set of challenges: emerging machine learning models; increasing hardware specialization brings a diverse set of acceleration primitives; growing tension between flexibility and performance. In this talk. I then discuss our experience in bringing foundational models to a variety of devices and hardware environments through machine learning compilation.




**Bio:** Tianqi Chen is currently an Assistant Professor at the Machine Learning Department and Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University. He is also the Chief Technologist of OctoML. He received his PhD. from the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. He has created many major learning systems that are widely adopted: XGBoost, TVM, and MLC-LLM.

Dan Fu (Stanford, Together)

[Monarch Mixer: Making Foundation Models More Efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS59IwGLvVs)

Abstract
Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures like Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. In this talk I'll discuss Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension. M2 mixes information along the sequence and model dimensions using Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically.




**Bio:** Dan Fu is a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, where he is co-advised by Christopher Ré and Kayvon Fatahalian. His research is at the intersection of systems and machine learning and focuses on developing algorithms and architectures to make machine learning more efficient.

Tri Dao (Stanford, Adept AI)

[FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMOAud7hZg4)

Abstract
Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).




**Bio:** Tri Dao is a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, co-advised by Christopher Ré and Stefano Ermon. He works at the interface of machine learning and systems, and his research interests include sequence models with long-range memory and structured matrices for compact deep learning models. His work has received the ICML 2022 Outstanding paper runner-up award.

[Optimizing Communications for Distributed and Decentralized Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7o2C0lPrKg)

Abstract
The rapid progress of machine learning in the last decade has been fueled by the increasing scale of data and compute. Today's training algorithms are often communication heavy, as a result, large-scale models are trained dominantly in a centralized environment such as data centers with fast network connections.

[Pathways Language Model and Model Scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_eBVwzOaw)

Abstract
Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, dense Transformer language model at Google, which we refer to as Pathways Language Model (PaLM). In this talk, we discuss the system considerations and model improvements necessary to train the PaLM model across 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways at very high efficiency levels. Next we share how scaling the model to 540B parameters results in state-of-the-art few shot learning results across hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. We will also share some of the more recent works built on top of PaLM that push the SOTA in various domains and democratize access to natural language processing.




**Bio:** Aakanksha has led the effort on training large language models at Google Research which led to the 540B PaLM model. Aakanksha has also been a core member of the Pathways project at Google.

[Mechanistic Interpretability - Reverse Engineering Learned Algorithms from Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7sjVMtb5Sg)

Abstract
Transformers are exceptionally powerful technologies that have quickly gone from smashing NLP benchmarks to being one of, if not the premier ML technology in a wide array of fields. Given their growing role in technological pipelines and society writ large, understanding how and why they work is a pressing issue. In this talk I give an overview of research on Mechanistic Interpretability, a field of work that has had substantial success picking apart transformers and understanding the algorithms that trained models use to reason. Topics covered include: the algorithm that toy LLMs can use to perform arithmetic accurately; how real-world LLMs do object identification; and how AlphaFold learns 2D projections of structures and then inflates them over time. Time permitting, I hope to discuss recent discoveries at EleutherAI currently under review for publication.




**Bio:** Stella Biderman is the head of research at EleutherAI, an online research lab that has revolutionized open access to large language models. She is best known for her work on democratizing LLMs, especially the GPT-Neo-2.7B, GPT-NeoX-20B, and BLOOM-176B models, all of which where the largest publicly available GPT-3-style LLMs in the world at time of release. Her work on publicly available datasets and evaluation frameworks has become an integral part of training foundation models in NLP. Her interest in open sourcing NLP models is primarily driven by her passion for interpretability research, a topic she has increasingly focused on as access to LLMs has increased. She proudly does not possess a PhD.

[A data-centric view on reliable generalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brHeIKX8ayw)

Abstract
Researchers have proposed many methods to make neural networks more reliable under distribution shift, yet there is still large room for improvement. Are better training algorithms or training data the more promising way forward? In this talk, we study this question in the context of computer vision and OpenAI's CLIP model for learning from image-text data. First, we survey the current robustness landscape based on a large-scale experimental study involving more than 200 different models and test conditions. The CLIP models stand out with unprecedented robustness gains on multiple challenging distribution shifts. To further improve CLIP, we then introduce new methods for reliably fine-tuning models by interpolating the weights of multiple models. Finally, we investigate the cause of CLIP's robustness via controlled experiments to disentangle the influence of language supervision and training distribution. While CLIP leveraged large scale language supervision for the first time, its robustness actually comes from the pre-training dataset. Based on our findings, we will conclude with initial experiments to improve the pre-training datasets for image-text models.

[Building Machine Learning Models like Open-Source Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oGxT_i7nk8)

Abstract
Pre-trained models have become a cornerstone of modern ML pipelines thanks to the fact that they can provide improved performance with less labeled data on downstream tasks. However, these models are typically created by a resource-rich research group that unilaterally decides how a given model should be built, trained, and released, after which point it is left as-is until a better pre-trained model comes along to completely supplant it. In this talk, I will present a vision for building machine learning models in the way that open-source software is developed - by a distributed community of contributors who iteratively build valuable artifacts through a mature set of tools including version control, continuous integration, merging, and more.

[Accelerating the Development of Professional Norms in Generative AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iyeV23d3Ig)

Abstract
The frontier of technology routinely races ahead of the capacity of politicians and regulators to craft wise policy and governance. When advances on the technological frontier carry broader social consequences, shaping technology toward social benefit and away from social harm falls primarily to technologists and commercial actors. In this respect, professional norms of responsible conduct are especially significant. We live now in such a moment with generative AI. With the recent shift from a “research lab” to “product lab” orientation, the commercial pressures to develop, deploy, and monetize will grow, potentially at the expense of safety and social considerations. In this talk, I examine how to accelerate the development of professional norms in generative AI, ranging from benchmarking, ethical review, open access versus closed access models, and independent organizations for auditing.

Abstract
In this talk we discuss how foundation models are beginning to validate a hypothesis formed over 70 years ago: statistical models which better compress their source data resultantly learn more fundamental and general capabilities from it. We start by covering some fundamentals of compression, and then describe how larger language models, spanning into the hundreds of billions of parameters, are actually state-of-the-art lossless compressors. We discuss some of the emergent capabilities and persistent limitations we may expect along the path to optimal compression.

Abstract
Data-centric AI is a new and exciting research topic in the AI community, but many organizations already build and maintain various "data-centric" applications whose goal is to produce high quality data. These range from traditional business data processing applications (e.g., "how much should we charge each of our customers this month?") to production ML systems such as recommendation engines. The fields of data and ML engineering have arisen in recent years to manage these applications, and both include many interesting novel tools and processes. In this talk we present lessons from data and ML engineering that could be interesting to apply in data-centric AI, based on our experience developing data and ML platforms that serve thousands of applications at a range of organizations. In particular, we will discuss lessons related to data monitoring and the challenges to apply it effectively in production ML systems.

[DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJTitzj0qBo)

Abstract
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) plays an important role in delivery and ride-hailing platforms. For example, Uber uses ETAs to calculate fares, estimate pickup times, match riders to drivers, plan deliveries, and more. Commonly used route planning algorithms predict an ETA conditioned on the best available route, but such ETA estimates can be unreliable when the actual route taken is not known in advance. In this talk, we describe an ETA post-processing system in which a deep residual ETA network (DeepETA) refines naive ETAs produced by a route planning algorithm. Offline experiments and online tests demonstrate that post-processing by DeepETA significantly improves upon the accuracy of naive ETAs as measured by mean and median absolute error. We further show that post-processing by DeepETA attains lower error than competitive baseline regression models.

[Improving Robustness and Interpretability in Vision and Language Grounding Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKKSXQvdCyE)

Abstract
Deep neural networks have enabled significant progress on many multi-modal grounding problems such as visual question answering (VQA), referring expression recognition (REF) which has several important applications such as in navigation, medical imaging, robotics and accessibility. In the last few years we have seen a huge improvement in how these models perform, some of them reaching human-level performance on several datasets. However, we find that these models could be exploiting strong biases in these datasets casting doubts on the actual progress.
For example, as a human, do you focus on the same visual object when you hear the sentences “the bus in the middle of the crowd” and “the crowd that the bus is in the middle of”? Neural networks do so. The exciting progress on understanding language in the context of an image is not due to the cleverness of the neural networks, but rather because of the shortcuts present in the evaluation datasets. In this talk, we show that state-of-the-art neural network approaches are easily fooled due to their failure in overcoming biases in the training datasets. We also show that the recent self-supervised BERT based multi-modal architectures (e.g. ViLBERT) are relatively more robust compared to other neural architectures. We propose methods to improve robustness (and generalization) of the current models. We show that while data augmentation is one way to increase robustness, multi-task learning is probably a less tedious route. Finally, we describe a mechanism for producing scalable and nonstationary benchmarks (and out-of-distribution hard splits) for testing the generalization capabilities of existing grounding models.

[Improving Transfer and Robustness of Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3yLSBSCUUw)

Abstract
An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness. Supervised contrastive learning is a promising method for training accurate models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to class collapse -- when all points in a class map to the same representation. In this talk, we discuss how to alleviate these problems to improve the geometry of supervised contrastive learning. We identify two key principles: balancing the right amount of geometric "spread" in the embedding space, and inducing an inductive bias towards subclass clustering. We introduce two mechanisms for achieving these aims in supervised contrastive learning, and show that doing so improves transfer learning and worst-group robustness. Next, we show how we can apply these insights to improve entity retrieval in open-domain NLP tasks (e.g., QA, search). We present a new method, TABi, that trains bi-encoders with a type-aware supervised contrastive loss and improves long-tailed entity retrieval.

[Learned Indexing and Sampling for Improving Query Performance in Big-Data Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHmpMoaodng)

Abstract
Traditional data analytics systems improve query efficiency via fine-grained, row-level indexing and sampling techniques. However, to keep up with the data volumes, increasingly many systems store and process datasets in large partitions containing hundreds of thousands of rows. Therefore, these analytics systems must adapt traditional techniques to work with coarse-grained data partitions as a basic unit to process queries efficiently.
In this talk, I will discuss two related ideas that combine learning techniques with partitioning designs to improve the query efficiency in the analytics systems. First, I will describe PS3, the first approximate query processing system that supports non-uniform, partition-level samples. PS3 reduces the number of partitions accessed by 3 to 70x to achieve the same error compared to a uniform sample of the partitions. Next, I will present OLO, an online learning framework that dynamically adapts data organization according to changes in query workload to minimize overall data access and movement. We show that dynamic reorganization outperforms a single, optimized partitioning scheme by up to 30% in end-to-end runtime.
I will conclude by discussing additional open problems in this area.

Abstract
Modern software systems and products increasingly rely on machine learning models to make data-driven decisions based on interactions with users, infrastructure and other systems. For broader adoption, this practice must (i) accommodate product engineers without ML backgrounds, (ii) support fine-grain product-metric evaluation and (iii) optimize for product goals. To address shortcomings of prior platforms, we introduce general principles for and the architecture of an ML platform, Looper, with simple APIs for decision-making and feedback collection.
Looper covers the end-to-end ML lifecycle from collecting training data and model training to deployment and inference, and extends support to personalization, causal evaluation with heterogenous treatment effects, and Bayesian tuning for product goals. During the 2021 production deployment Looper simultaneously hosted 440-1,000 ML models that made 4-6 million real-time decisions per second. We sum up experiences of platform adopters and describe their learning curve.

Abstract
Alpa (https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa) automates model-parallel training of large deep learning models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Alpa distributes the training of large deep learning models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans.

[Scaling Multilingual Machine Translation to Thousands of Language Directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nAiqqUn_3c)

Abstract
Existing work in translation has demonstrated the potential of massively multilingual machine translation by training a single model able to translate between any pair of languages. However, much of this work is English-Centric by training only on data which was translated from or to English. While this is supported by large sources of training data, it does not reflect translation needs worldwide. In this talk, I will describe how we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open source a training dataset that covers thousands of language directions with supervised data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems of WMT.

TinyML enables on-device analysis of sensor data (vision, audio, IMU, etc.) at ultra-low-power consumption (<1mW). Processing data close to the sensor allows for an expansive new variety of always-on ML use-cases that preserve bandwidth, latency, and energy while improving responsiveness and maintaining privacy. This talk introduces the vision behind TinyML and showcases some of the interesting applications that TinyML is enabling in the field, from wildlife conservation to supporting public health initiatives. Yet, there are still numerous technical hardware and software challenges to address. Tight memory and storage constraints, MCU heterogeneity, software fragmentation and a lack of relevant large-scale datasets pose a substantial barrier to developing TinyML applications. To this end, the talk touches upon some of the research opportunities for unlocking the full potential of TinyML.

[A vision for interactive model development: efficient machine learning by bringing domain experts in the loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9LbJBzK2HQ)

Abstract
Building computer vision models today is an exercise in patience--days to weeks for human annotators to label data, hours to days to train and evaluate models, weeks to months of iteration to reach a production model. Without tolerance for this timeline or access to the massive compute and human resources required, building an accurate model can be challenging if not impossible. In this talk, we discuss a vision for interactive model development with iteration cycles of minutes, not weeks. We believe the key to this is integrating the domain expert at key points in the model building cycle and leveraging supervision cues above just example-level annotation. We will discuss our recent progress toward aspects of this goal: judiciously choosing when to use the machine and when to use the domain expert for fast, low label budget model training (CVPR 2021, ICCV 2021), building confidence in model performance with low-shot validation (ICCV 2021 Oral), and some initial tools for rapidly defining correctness criteria.

[Always-on Dataframe Visualizations with Lux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrmSoU8jHnw)

Abstract
Visualizations help data scientists discover trends, patterns, identify outliers, and derive insights from their data. However, existing visualization libraries in Python require users to write a substantial amount of code for plotting even a single visualization, often hindering the flow of data exploration. In this talk, you will learn about Lux, a lightweight visualization tool on top of pandas dataframes. Lux recommends visualizations for free to users as they explore their data within a Jupyter notebook without the need to write additional code. Lux is used by data scientists across a variety of industries and sectors and has nearly 66k total downloads and over 3.3k stars on GitHub. For more information, see: https://github.com/lux-org/lux

[Implementing Symbols and Rules with Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmKmbImRguE)

Abstract
Many aspects of human language and reasoning are well explained in terms of symbols and rules. However, state-of-the-art computational models are based on large neural networks which lack explicit symbolic representations of the type frequently used in cognitive theories. One response has been the development of neuro-symbolic models which introduce explicit representations of symbols into neural network architectures or loss functions. In terms of Marr's levels of analysis, such approaches achieve symbolic reasoning at the computational level ("what the system does and why") by introducing symbols and rules at the implementation and algorithmic levels. In this talk, I will consider an alternative: can neural networks (without any explicit symbolic components) nonetheless implement symbolic reasoning at the computational level? I will describe several diagnostic tests of "symbolic" and "rule-governed" behavior and use these tests to analyze neural models of visual and language processing. Our results show that on many counts, neural models appear to encode symbol-like concepts (e.g., conceptual representations that are abstract, systematic, and modular), but not perfectly so. Analysis of the failure cases reveals that future work is needed on methodological tools for analyzing neural networks, as well as refinement of models of hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning in humans, in order to determine whether neural networks' deviations from the symbolic paradigm are a feature or a bug.
