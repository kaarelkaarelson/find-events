Martin Maas (Google Deepmind)

[A Taxonomy of Machine Learning for Systems Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_UdAR_5jqk)

Abstract
Machine learning has the potential to significantly improve computer systems. While recent research in this area has shown great promise, not all problems are equally well-suited for applying ML techniques, and some remaining challenges have prevented wider adoption of ML in systems. In this talk, I will introduce a taxonomy to classify machine learning for systems approaches, discuss how to identify cases that are a good fit for machine learning, and lay out a longer-term vision of how different systems can be improved using ML techniques, ranging from computer architecture to language runtimes.




**Bio:** Martin Maas is a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. His research interests are in language runtimes, computer architecture, systems, and machine learning, with a focus on applying machine learning to systems problems.

Tim Dettmers (UW)

[Democratizing Foundation Models via k-bit Quantization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsMcVkTXZrk)

Abstract
Foundation models are effective tools for many tasks but are challenging to finetune and inference due to their GPU memory requirements. Compressing foundation models with k-bit quantization makes them more accessible with minimal resources, but k-bit quantization can lead to degradation in model quality. In this lecture, I will talk about fundamental insights into how to compress foundation models with quantization while maintaining their predictive performance. We will learn about emergent outliers in large language models (LLMs) and how they affect performance during 8-bit quantization. We will learn how to do effective k-bit compression of pretrained large language models such that we maximize their density of predictive performance per bit. We will also talk about how to do efficient fine-tuning of quantized 4-bit LLMs (QLoRA) and how this helps to build state-of-the-art chatbots.




**Bio:** Tim Dettmers is a graduating PhD student advised by Luke Zettlemoyer at the University of Washington in Seattle. He holds degrees in applied math and computer science and has a background in industrial automation. His primary research goal is to democratize foundation models by making them more efficient and accessible through quantization, sparsification, and building machine learning systems that use consumer-grade hardware. He is the creator of the bitsandbytes library. Tim runs a blog about deep learning, GPUs, and PhD life at timdettmers.com.

Deepak Narayanan (Nvidia)

[Training Large Language Models at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA1l96tjrs4)

Abstract
Training LLMs efficiently is challenging for a few reasons: training can require yottaFLOPs of compute, and accelerators have limited memory capacity making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naïve usage of these methods leads to scaling issues at thousands of GPUs. In this talk, I describe various systems innovations incorporated into Megatron-LM (https://github.com/nvidia/megatron-lm) that allow us to run training iterations for models with up to a trillion parameters on thousands of GPUs.




**Bio:** Deepak is a Senior Applied Deep Learning Research Scientist in the ADLR group at NVIDIA, where he builds software systems to more efficiently train and serve LLMs. He graduated from Stanford with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in September 2021, where he was advised by Prof. Matei Zaharia.

Travis Addair (Predibase)

[Serving 100s of Fine-Tuned LLMs on 1 GPU with LoRAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6zVvfvIFpc)

Abstract
Smaller, specialized language models such as LLaMA-2-7b can outperform larger general-purpose models like GPT-4 when fine-tuned on proprietary data to perform a single task. But serving many fine-tuned LLMs in production can quickly add up to tens of thousands of dollars per month in cloud costs when each model requires its own dedicated GPU resources. LoRA Exchange (LoRAX) is an LLM inference system built for serving numerous fine-tuned LLMs using a shared set of GPU resources. With LoRAX, users can pack over 100 task-specific models into a single GPU, significantly reducing the expenses associated with serving fine-tuned models by orders of magnitude over dedicated deployments. In this seminar, we'll explore the challenges of serving fine-tuned LLMs in production, and the motivation behind building a system like LoRAX. We'll introduce parameter efficient fine-tuning adapters like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and show how LoRAX dynamically loads and exchanges different adapters at runtime, leveraging a tiered weight cache to speed up this exchange process. Additionally, we'll show how LoRAX achieves high throughput with continuous multi-adapter batching, allowing requests from different fine-tuned adapters to batch together within a single decoding step.




**Bio:** Travis Addair is co-founder and CTO of Predibase, the AI platform for engineers. Within the Linux Foundation, he serves as lead maintainer for the Horovod distributed deep learning framework and is a co-maintainer of the Ludwig automated deep learning framework. In the past, he led Uber's deep learning training team as part of the Michelangelo machine learning platform.

Dan Fu (Stanford, Together)

[Monarch Mixer: Making Foundation Models More Efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS59IwGLvVs)

Abstract
Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures like Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. In this talk I'll discuss Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension. M2 mixes information along the sequence and model dimensions using Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically.




**Bio:** Dan Fu is a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, where he is co-advised by Christopher Ré and Kayvon Fatahalian. His research is at the intersection of systems and machine learning and focuses on developing algorithms and architectures to make machine learning more efficient.

Tri Dao (Stanford, Adept AI)

[FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMOAud7hZg4)

Abstract
Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).




**Bio:** Tri Dao is a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, co-advised by Christopher Ré and Stefano Ermon. He works at the interface of machine learning and systems, and his research interests include sequence models with long-range memory and structured matrices for compact deep learning models. His work has received the ICML 2022 Outstanding paper runner-up award.

Ce Zhang (ETH, Together Compute)

[Optimizing Communications for Distributed and Decentralized Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7o2C0lPrKg)

Abstract
The rapid progress of machine learning in the last decade has been fueled by the increasing scale of data and compute. Today's training algorithms are often communication heavy, as a result, large-scale models are trained dominantly in a centralized environment such as data centers with fast network connections. This strong dependency on fast interconnections is becoming the limiting factor of further scaling, not only for the data center setting but also for alternative decentralized infrastructures such as spot instances and geo-distributed volunteer computes. In this talk, I will discuss our research in communication-efficient distributed learning and our current effort in training foundation models in a decentralized way.




**Bio:** Ce is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. The mission of his research is to make machine learning techniques widely accessible---while being cost-efficient and trustworthy---to everyone who wants to use them to make our world a better place. He believes in a system approach to enabling this goal, and his current research focuses on building next-generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-centric, human-centric, and declaratively scalable. Before joining ETH, Ce finished his PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, both advised by Christopher Ré. His work has received recognitions such as the SIGMOD Best Paper Award, SIGMOD Research Highlight Award, Google Focused Research Award, an ERC Starting Grant, and has been featured and reported by Science, Nature, the Communications of the ACM, and a various media outlets such as Atlantic, WIRED, Quanta Magazine, etc.

[Pathways Language Model and Model Scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_eBVwzOaw)

Abstract
Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, dense Transformer language model at Google, which we refer to as Pathways Language Model (PaLM). In this talk, we discuss the system considerations and model improvements necessary to train the PaLM model across 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways at very high efficiency levels. Next we share how scaling the model to 540B parameters results in state-of-the-art few shot learning results across hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. We will also share some of the more recent works built on top of PaLM that push the SOTA in various domains and democratize access to natural language processing.




**Bio:** Aakanksha has led the effort on training large language models at Google Research which led to the 540B PaLM model. Aakanksha has also been a core member of the Pathways project at Google. Prior to joining Google, Aakanksha led interdisciplinary teams at Microsoft Research and Princeton University across machine learning, distributed systems and networking. Aakanksha completed her PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, and was awarded the Paul Baran Marconi Young Scholar Award for the outstanding scientific contributions in the field of communications and the Internet.

Stella Biderman (EleutherAI, Booz Allen Hamilton)

[Mechanistic Interpretability - Reverse Engineering Learned Algorithms from Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7sjVMtb5Sg)

Abstract
Transformers are exceptionally powerful technologies that have quickly gone from smashing NLP benchmarks to being one of, if not the premier ML technology in a wide array of fields. Given their growing role in technological pipelines and society writ large, understanding how and why they work is a pressing issue. In this talk I give an overview of research on Mechanistic Interpretability, a field of work that has had substantial success picking apart transformers and understanding the algorithms that trained models use to reason. Topics covered include: the algorithm that toy LLMs can use to perform arithmetic accurately; how real-world LLMs do object identification; and how AlphaFold learns 2D projections of structures and then inflates them over time. Time permitting, I hope to discuss recent discoveries at EleutherAI currently under review for publication.




**Bio:** Stella Biderman is the head of research at EleutherAI, an online research lab that has revolutionized open access to large language models. She is best known for her work on democratizing LLMs, especially the GPT-Neo-2.7B, GPT-NeoX-20B, and BLOOM-176B models, all of which where the largest publicly available GPT-3-style LLMs in the world at time of release. Her work on publicly available datasets and evaluation frameworks has become an integral part of training foundation models in NLP. Her interest in open sourcing NLP models is primarily driven by her passion for interpretability research, a topic she has increasingly focused on as access to LLMs has increased. She proudly does not possess a PhD.

Ludwig Schmidt (University of Washington)

[A data-centric view on reliable generalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brHeIKX8ayw)

Abstract
Researchers have proposed many methods to make neural networks more reliable under distribution shift, yet there is still large room for improvement. Are better training algorithms or training data the more promising way forward? In this talk, we study this question in the context of computer vision and OpenAI's CLIP model for learning from image-text data. First, we survey the current robustness landscape based on a large-scale experimental study involving more than 200 different models and test conditions. The CLIP models stand out with unprecedented robustness gains on multiple challenging distribution shifts. To further improve CLIP, we then introduce new methods for reliably fine-tuning models by interpolating the weights of multiple models. Finally, we investigate the cause of CLIP's robustness via controlled experiments to disentangle the influence of language supervision and training distribution. While CLIP leveraged large scale language supervision for the first time, its robustness actually comes from the pre-training dataset. Based on our findings, we will conclude with initial experiments to improve the pre-training datasets for image-text models.




**Bio:** Ludwig Schmidt is an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Ludwig's research interests revolve around the empirical foundations of machine learning, often with a focus on datasets, evaluation, reliable methods, and large models.

Colin Raffel (UNC, HuggingFace)

[Building Machine Learning Models like Open-Source Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oGxT_i7nk8)

Abstract
Pre-trained models have become a cornerstone of modern ML pipelines thanks to the fact that they can provide improved performance with less labeled data on downstream tasks. However, these models are typically created by a resource-rich research group that unilaterally decides how a given model should be built, trained, and released, after which point it is left as-is until a better pre-trained model comes along to completely supplant it. In this talk, I will present a vision for building machine learning models in the way that open-source software is developed - by a distributed community of contributors who iteratively build valuable artifacts through a mature set of tools including version control, continuous integration, merging, and more.




**Bio:** Colin Raffel is an Assistant Professor at UNC Chapel Hill and a Faculty Researcher at Hugging Face. His work aims to make it easy to get computers to do new things. Consequently, he works mainly on machine learning (enabling computers to learn from examples) and natural language processing (enabling computers to communicate in natural language). He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2016 and spent five years as a research scientist at Google Brain.

[Accelerating the Development of Professional Norms in Generative AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iyeV23d3Ig)

Abstract
The frontier of technology routinely races ahead of the capacity of politicians and regulators to craft wise policy and governance. When advances on the technological frontier carry broader social consequences, shaping technology toward social benefit and away from social harm falls primarily to technologists and commercial actors. In this respect, professional norms of responsible conduct are especially significant. We live now in such a moment with generative AI. With the recent shift from a “research lab” to “product lab” orientation, the commercial pressures to develop, deploy, and monetize will grow, potentially at the expense of safety and social considerations. In this talk, I examine how to accelerate the development of professional norms in generative AI, ranging from benchmarking, ethical review, open access versus closed access models, and independent organizations for auditing.




**Bio:** Professor of Political Science, director of the Center for Ethics in Society, co-director of the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, and associate director of the Institute for Human-Centered AI.

[Poisoning Web-Scale Training Datasets is Practical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9jf1ikcGyk)

Abstract
In this talk I introduce the first practical poisoning attack on large machine learning datasets. With our attack I could have poisoned (but didn't!) the training dataset for anyone who has used LAION-400M in the last six months. While we take steps to mitigate these attacks, they come at a (sometimes significant) cost to utility. Addressing these challenges will require new categories of defenses to simultaneously allow models to train on large datasets while also being robust to adversarial training data.

[Compression for AGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO4TPJkeaaU)

Abstract
In this talk we discuss how foundation models are beginning to validate a hypothesis formed over 70 years ago: statistical models which better compress their source data resultantly learn more fundamental and general capabilities from it. We start by covering some fundamentals of compression, and then describe how larger language models, spanning into the hundreds of billions of parameters, are actually state-of-the-art lossless compressors. We discuss some of the emergent capabilities and persistent limitations we may expect along the path to optimal compression.

Scale appears to be the winning recipe in today's leaderboards. And yet, extreme-scale neural models are (un)surprisingly brittle and make errors that are often nonsensical and even counterintuitive.

Abstract
Taking stock of ML Infra problems with potential to benefit from systematic analysis. ML currently requires running large amounts experiments to compensate for the lack of analysis. Modern AI infrastructure (major clouds) is efficient in creating, training, and deploying thousands of model. At the same time, improving production models performance, accurate estimation of models performance in production, web data relevance, risk mitigation - these are ad hoc and experiment-driven processes. Analytical analysis for Production \[distributed, large-scale, rapidly changing environment\] ML can help to direct and hopefully replace the empirical and manual processes.

[What can Data-Centric AI Learn from Data and ML Engineering?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqDgxP8DcJA)

Abstract
Data-centric AI is a new and exciting research topic in the AI community, but many organizations already build and maintain various "data-centric" applications whose goal is to produce high quality data. These range from traditional business data processing applications (e.g., "how much should we charge each of our customers this month?") to production ML systems such as recommendation engines. The fields of data and ML engineering have arisen in recent years to manage these applications, and both include many interesting novel tools and processes. In this talk we present lessons from data and ML engineering that could be interesting to apply in data-centric AI, based on our experience developing data and ML platforms that serve thousands of applications at a range of organizations. In particular, we will discuss lessons related to data monitoring and the challenges to apply it effectively in production ML systems.

[DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJTitzj0qBo)

Abstract
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) plays an important role in delivery and ride-hailing platforms. For example, Uber uses ETAs to calculate fares, estimate pickup times, match riders to drivers, plan deliveries, and more. Commonly used route planning algorithms predict an ETA conditioned on the best available route, but such ETA estimates can be unreliable when the actual route taken is not known in advance. In this talk, we describe an ETA post-processing system in which a deep residual ETA network (DeepETA) refines naive ETAs produced by a route planning algorithm. Offline experiments and online tests demonstrate that post-processing by DeepETA significantly improves upon the accuracy of naive ETAs as measured by mean and median absolute error. We further show that post-processing by DeepETA attains lower error than competitive baseline regression models.

[Improving Robustness and Interpretability in Vision and Language Grounding Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKKSXQvdCyE)

Abstract
Deep neural networks have enabled significant progress on many multi-modal grounding problems such as visual question answering (VQA), referring expression recognition (REF) which has several important applications such as in navigation, medical imaging, robotics and accessibility. In the last few years we have seen a huge improvement in how these models perform, some of them reaching human-level performance on several datasets. However, we find that these models could be exploiting strong biases in these datasets casting doubts on the actual progress.
For example, as a human, do you focus on the same visual object when you hear the sentences “the bus in the middle of the crowd” and “the crowd that the bus is in the middle of”? Neural networks do so. The exciting progress on understanding language in the context of an image is not due to the cleverness of the neural networks, but rather because of the shortcuts present in the evaluation datasets. In this talk, we show that state-of-the-art neural network approaches are easily fooled due to their failure in overcoming biases in the training datasets. We also show that the recent self-supervised BERT based multi-modal architectures (e.g. ViLBERT) are relatively more robust compared to other neural architectures. We propose methods to improve robustness (and generalization) of the current models. We show that while data augmentation is one way to increase robustness, multi-task learning is probably a less tedious route. Finally, we describe a mechanism for producing scalable and nonstationary benchmarks (and out-of-distribution hard splits) for testing the generalization capabilities of existing grounding models.

[Improving Transfer and Robustness of Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3yLSBSCUUw)

Abstract
An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness. Supervised contrastive learning is a promising method for training accurate models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to class collapse -- when all points in a class map to the same representation. In this talk, we discuss how to alleviate these problems to improve the geometry of supervised contrastive learning. We identify two key principles: balancing the right amount of geometric "spread" in the embedding space, and inducing an inductive bias towards subclass clustering. We introduce two mechanisms for achieving these aims in supervised contrastive learning, and show that doing so improves transfer learning and worst-group robustness. Next, we show how we can apply these insights to improve entity retrieval in open-domain NLP tasks (e.g., QA, search). We present a new method, TABi, that trains bi-encoders with a type-aware supervised contrastive loss and improves long-tailed entity retrieval.

[Learned Indexing and Sampling for Improving Query Performance in Big-Data Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHmpMoaodng)

Abstract
Traditional data analytics systems improve query efficiency via fine-grained, row-level indexing and sampling techniques. However, to keep up with the data volumes, increasingly many systems store and process datasets in large partitions containing hundreds of thousands of rows. Therefore, these analytics systems must adapt traditional techniques to work with coarse-grained data partitions as a basic unit to process queries efficiently.
In this talk, I will discuss two related ideas that combine learning techniques with partitioning designs to improve the query efficiency in the analytics systems. First, I will describe PS3, the first approximate query processing system that supports non-uniform, partition-level samples. PS3 reduces the number of partitions accessed by 3 to 70x to achieve the same error compared to a uniform sample of the partitions. Next, I will present OLO, an online learning framework that dynamically adapts data organization according to changes in query workload to minimize overall data access and movement. We show that dynamic reorganization outperforms a single, optimized partitioning scheme by up to 30% in end-to-end runtime.
I will conclude by discussing additional open problems in this area.

[Looper: an end-to-end ML platform for product decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZHJK9VWPY)

Abstract
Modern software systems and products increasingly rely on machine learning models to make data-driven decisions based on interactions with users, infrastructure and other systems. For broader adoption, this practice must (i) accommodate product engineers without ML backgrounds, (ii) support fine-grain product-metric evaluation and (iii) optimize for product goals. To address shortcomings of prior platforms, we introduce general principles for and the architecture of an ML platform, Looper, with simple APIs for decision-making and feedback collection.
Looper covers the end-to-end ML lifecycle from collecting training data and model training to deployment and inference, and extends support to personalization, causal evaluation with heterogenous treatment effects, and Bayesian tuning for product goals. During the 2021 production deployment Looper simultaneously hosted 440-1,000 ML models that made 4-6 million real-time decisions per second. We sum up experiences of platform adopters and describe their learning curve.

[Alpa: Automated Model-Parallel Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1NXHjcl6V0)

Abstract
Alpa (https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa) automates model-parallel training of large deep learning models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Alpa distributes the training of large deep learning models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans.

[Scaling Multilingual Machine Translation to Thousands of Language Directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nAiqqUn_3c)

Abstract
Existing work in translation has demonstrated the potential of massively multilingual machine translation by training a single model able to translate between any pair of languages. However, much of this work is English-Centric by training only on data which was translated from or to English. While this is supported by large sources of training data, it does not reflect translation needs worldwide. In this talk, I will describe how we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open source a training dataset that covers thousands of language directions with supervised data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems of WMT.

Abstract
Tiny machine learning (TinyML) is a fast-growing field at the intersection of ML algorithms and low-cost embedded systems. TinyML enables on-device analysis of sensor data (vision, audio, IMU, etc.) at ultra-low-power consumption (<1mW). Processing data close to the sensor allows for an expansive new variety of always-on ML use-cases that preserve bandwidth, latency, and energy while improving responsiveness and maintaining privacy. This talk introduces the vision behind TinyML and showcases some of the interesting applications that TinyML is enabling in the field, from wildlife conservation to supporting public health initiatives. Yet, there are still numerous technical hardware and software challenges to address. Tight memory and storage constraints, MCU heterogeneity, software fragmentation and a lack of relevant large-scale datasets pose a substantial barrier to developing TinyML applications. To this end, the talk touches upon some of the research opportunities for unlocking the full potential of TinyML.

[A vision for interactive model development: efficient machine learning by bringing domain experts in the loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9LbJBzK2HQ)

Abstract
Building computer vision models today is an exercise in patience--days to weeks for human annotators to label data, hours to days to train and evaluate models, weeks to months of iteration to reach a production model. Without tolerance for this timeline or access to the massive compute and human resources required, building an accurate model can be challenging if not impossible. In this talk, we discuss a vision for interactive model development with iteration cycles of minutes, not weeks. We believe the key to this is integrating the domain expert at key points in the model building cycle and leveraging supervision cues above just example-level annotation. We will discuss our recent progress toward aspects of this goal: judiciously choosing when to use the machine and when to use the domain expert for fast, low label budget model training (CVPR 2021, ICCV 2021), building confidence in model performance with low-shot validation (ICCV 2021 Oral), and some initial tools for rapidly defining correctness criteria.

[Implementing Symbols and Rules with Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmKmbImRguE)

Abstract
Many aspects of human language and reasoning are well explained in terms of symbols and rules. However, state-of-the-art computational models are based on large neural networks which lack explicit symbolic representations of the type frequently used in cognitive theories. One response has been the development of neuro-symbolic models which introduce explicit representations of symbols into neural network architectures or loss functions. In terms of Marr's levels of analysis, such approaches achieve symbolic reasoning at the computational level ("what the system does and why") by introducing symbols and rules at the implementation and algorithmic levels. In this talk, I will consider an alternative: can neural networks (without any explicit symbolic components) nonetheless implement symbolic reasoning at the computational level? I will describe several diagnostic tests of "symbolic" and "rule-governed" behavior and use these tests to analyze neural models of visual and language processing. Our results show that on many counts, neural models appear to encode symbol-like concepts (e.g., conceptual representations that are abstract, systematic, and modular), but not perfectly so. Analysis of the failure cases reveals that future work is needed on methodological tools for analyzing neural networks, as well as refinement of models of hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning in humans, in order to determine whether neural networks' deviations from the symbolic paradigm are a feature or a bug.

[Data selection for Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Over Quantity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bNwn8EHqOU)

Abstract
Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, improve the data efficiency of machine learning by identifying the most informative data points to label or train on. Across the data selection literature, there are many ways to identify these training examples. However, classical data selection methods are prohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning because of the larger datasets and models. This talk will describe two techniques to make data selection methods more tractable. First, "selection via proxy" (SVP) avoids expensive training and reduces the computation per example by using smaller proxy models to quantify the informativeness of each example. Second, "similarity search for efficient active learning and search" (SEALS) reduces the number of examples processed by restricting the candidate pool for labeling to the nearest neighbors of the currently labeled set instead of scanning over all of the unlabeled data. Both methods lead to order of magnitude performance improvements, making active learning applications on billions of unlabeled images practical for the first time.

[Designing Sustainable Datacenters with and for AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPrFL2gWmTY)

Abstract
Machine learning has witnessed exponential growth over the recent years. In this talk, we will first explore the environmental implications of the super-linear growth trend of AI from a holistic perspective, spanning data, algorithms, and system hardware. System efficiency optimizations can significantly help reducing the carbon footprint of AI systems. However, predictions show that the efficiency improvements will not be enough to reduce the overall resource needs of AI as Jevon's Paradox suggests "efficiency increases consumption". Therefore, we need to design our datacenters with sustainability in mind, using renewable energy every hour of every day. Relying on wind and solar energy 24/7 is challenging due to their intermittent nature. To cope with the fluctuations of renewable energy generation, multiple solutions can be applied such as energy storage and carbon aware scheduling for the workloads. In this talk, I will introduce a framework to analyze the multi-dimensional solution space by taking into account the operational and embodided footprint of the solutions and further how AI can be a part of the solution.

[Efficiently Constructing Datasets for Diverse Datatypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbnAYeSJ3EU)

Abstract
Building large datasets for data-hungry models is a key challenge in modern machine learning. Weak supervision frameworks have become a popular way to bypass this bottleneck. These approaches synthesize multiple noisy but cheaply-acquired estimates of labels into a set of high-quality pseudolabels for downstream training. In this talk, I introduce a technique that fuses weak supervision with structured prediction, enabling WS techniques to be applied to extremely diverse types of data. This approach allows for labels that can be continuous, manifold-valued (including, for example, points in hyperbolic space), rankings, sequences, graphs, and more. I will discuss theoretical guarantees for this universal weak supervision technique, connecting the consistency of weak supervision estimators to low-distortion embeddings of metric spaces. I will show experimental results in a variety of problems, including learning to rank, geodesic regression, and semantic dependency parsing. Finally I will present and discuss future opportunities for automated dataset construction.

[Resource-Efficient Execution of Deep Learning Computations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RKmXhzpZN8)

Abstract
Deep Learning models have enabled state-of-the-art results across a broad range of applications; however, training these models is extremely time- and resource-intensive, taking weeks on clusters with thousands of expensive accelerators in the extreme case. In this talk, I will describe two ideas that help improve the resource efficiency of model training. In the first half of the talk, I will discuss how pipelining can be used to accelerate distributed training. Pipeline parallelism facilitates model training with lower communication overhead than previous methods while still ensuring high compute resource utilization. Pipeline parallelism also enables the efficient training of large models that do not fit on a single worker; for example, we used pipeline parallelism at Nvidia to efficiently scale training to language models with a trillion parameters on 3000+ GPUs. In the second half of this talk, I will describe how resources in a shared cluster with heterogeneous compute resources (e.g., different types of hardware accelerators) should be partitioned among different users to optimize objectives specified over one or more training jobs. Heterogeneity-aware scheduling can improve various scheduling objectives, such as average completion time, makespan, or cloud computing resource cost, by up to 3.5x.

[Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse Training for Neural Network Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGPzuwoxmCs)

Abstract
Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.

[Systems Support for Federated Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcbOMbg4F9g)

Abstract
Although theoretical federated learning research is growing exponentially, we are far from putting those theories into practice. In this talk, I will share our ventures into building practical systems for two extremities of federated learning. Sol is a cross-silo federated learning and analytics system that tackles network latency and bandwidth challenges faced by distributed computation between far-apart data sites. Oort, in contrast, is a cross-device federated learning system that enables training and testing on representative data distributions despite unpredictable device availability. Both deal with systems and network characteristics in the wild that are hard to account for in analytical models. I'll then share the challenges in systematically evaluating federated learning systems that have led to a disconnect between theoretical conclusions and performance in the wild. I'll conclude this talk by introducing FedScale, which is an extensible framework for evaluation and benchmarking in realistic settings to democratize practical federated learning for researchers and practitioners alike. All these systems are open-source and available at https://github.com/symbioticlab.

[Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvQ3ncuriCM)

Abstract
A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps. We introduce a simple sequence model based on the fundamental state space representation $x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$ and show that it combines the strengths of several model families. Furthermore, we show that the HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization can be incorporated into the state matrix $A$, producing a class of structured models that handles long-range dependencies mathematically and can be computed very efficiently. The Structured State Space (S3) model achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation 60X faster, (iii) SotA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.

[Data-efficient and Robust Learning from Massive Datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmn8SNojTlA)

Abstract
Large datasets have been crucial to the success of modern machine learning models. However, training on massive data has two major limitations. First, it is contingent on exceptionally large and expensive computational resources, and incurs a substantial cost due to the significant energy consumption. Second, in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection, big data contains highly imbalanced classes and noisy labels. In such cases, training on the entire data does not result in a high-quality model.
In this talk, I will argue that we can address the above limitations by developing techniques that can identify and extract the representative subsets for learning from massive datasets. Training on representative subsets not only reduces the substantial costs of learning from big data, but also improves their accuracy and robustness against noisy labels. I will discuss how we can develop theoretically rigorous techniques that provide strong guarantees for the quality of the extracted subsets, as well as the learned models’ quality and robustness against noisy labels. I will also show the effectiveness of such methods in practice for data-efficient and robust learning.

[MLOps System Design for Development and Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XCsi64HLQ8)

Abstract
While ML model development is a challenging process, the management of these models becomes even more complex once they're in production. Shifting data distributions, upstream pipeline failures, and model predictions impacting the very dataset they’re trained on can create thorny feedback loops between development and production. In this talk, we’ll examine some naive ML workflows that don’t take the development-production feedback loop into account and explore why they break down. Next, we'll showcase some system design principles that will help manage these feedback loops more effectively. Finally, we’ll examine several industry case studies where teams have applied these principles to their production ML systems.

Compared to existing ML systems, our approaches enable faster ML training/inference and stronger correctness guarantees while requiring significantly less human effort.

Abstract
Software bugs cost millions of dollars to the US economy. Improving software reliability has been one of the primary concerns of Software Engineering, Security, Programming Language, and Verification research over decades. Researchers developed numerous automatic bug-finding tools, either based on static code analysis or analyzing dynamic code behavior. However, the adoption of these methods in the real-world is still limited, partly because most of them require a significant amount of manual work from developers and have a steep learning curve. In this talk, I will discuss how machine learning-based approaches can help us to automate and scale up the bug-finding (especially with respect to fuzz-testing) and bug-fixing process for large real-world programs.

Abstract
The proliferation of edge devices and the gigantic amount of data they generate make it no longer feasible to transmit all the data to the cloud for processing. Such constraints fuel the need to move the intelligence from the cloud to the edge where data reside. In this talk, we will present our works on how we bring the power of deep learning to edge devices to realize the vision of Artificial Intelligence of Things.
First, we will present our work on designing adaptive frameworks that empower AI-embedded edge devices to adapt to the inherently dynamic runtime resources to enable elastic on-device AI. Second, we shift from the single edge device setting to the distributed setting for the task of distributed on-device inference. We will focus on one killer application of edge computing, and present a distributed workload-adaptive framework for low-latency high-throughput large-scale live video analytics. Third, we will present our work on designing a distributed on-device training framework that significantly enhances the on-device training efficiency without compromising the training quality. The results and insights obtained in those works are also useful in designing many other modern machine learning systems.

Abstract
SafePredict is a meta-algorithm for machine learning applications that strategically refuses to accept the predictions of an underlying machine learning algorithm or algorithms. The goal is to achieve a user-specified correctness rate on the non-refused predictions without refusing too much. We show applications to an on-line learning setting in which the data-to-class mapping is not independent and identically distributed (not iid).
In related work, we look at classification problems where we are willing to guess, on average, k classes in the hopes that one is correct. We compare such an approach in which we always choose the top k most likely classes.
Finally, we consider the problem of selective sampling in settings where evaluating each sample is expensive. We build on and improve the Horvitz-Thompson and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted sampling methods.

[Distributed ML System for Large-scale Models: Dynamic Distributed Training and Scalable Federated Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY7pCYTC8pQ)

Abstract
In modern AI, large-scale deep learning models have emerged as the core technology behind many important Internet businesses, such as Search/ADs/Recommendation System/CV/NLP. BERT, Vision Transformer, GPT-3, and Switch Transformer models scale up the model size to a billion or even trillion number of parameters, showing non-trivial accuracy improvement for nearly all learning tasks. Distributed training using cloud clusters is key to the successful training of such large-scale models in a timely manner. Developing more advanced distributed training systems and algorithms can either reduce the energy cost or enable us to train even larger models. Furthermore, it is also essential to develop disruptive learning paradigms like federated learning, which can not only protect the privacy of users but also distribute the burden of handling unprecedented big data and models.
This talk will mainly focus on distributed ML systems for large-scale models: dynamic distributed training for the cloud cluster (https://DistML.ai) and scale federated learning for the edge devices (https://FedML.ai). In the first part, I will introduce PipeTransformer, an automated elastic pipelining for distributed training of Transformer models (BERT and ViT). In PipeTransformer, we design an adaptive on the fly freeze algorithm that can identify and freeze some layers gradually during training, and an elastic pipelining system that can dynamically reduce GPU resources to train the remaining active layers, and also forks more pipelines on released GPU resources to enlarge the width of data parallelism. In the second part, I will talk about scalable federated learning towards training large-scale models on resource-constrained edge devices and FedML Ecosystem, which aims at ubiquitously distributed training at the edge for diverse AI applications such as CV NLP, GraphNN, and IoT.

[Scalable, Accurate, Robust Binary Analysis with Transfer Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbVVOb7xTdU)

Abstract
Binary program analysis is a fundamental building block for a broad spectrum of security tasks. Essentially, binary analysis encapsulates a diverse set of tasks that aim to understand and analyze behaviors/semantics of binary programs. Existing approaches often tackle each analysis task independently and heavily employ ad-hoc task-specific brittle heuristics. While recent ML-based approaches have shown some early promise, they too tend to learn spurious features and overfit to specific tasks without understanding the underlying program semantics.
In this talk, I will describe two of our recent projects that use transfer learning to learn binary program semantics and transfer the learned knowledge for different binary analysis tasks. Our key observation is that by designing a pretraining task that can learn binary code semantics, we can drastically boost the performance of binary analysis tasks. Our pretraining task is fully self-supervised -- it does not need expensive labeling effort and therefore can easily generalize across different architectures, operating systems, compilers, optimizations, and obfuscations. Extensive experiments show that our approach drastically improves the performance of popular tasks like binary disassembly and matching semantically similar binary functions.

Abstract
Progress on large autoregressive models for NLP applications has been transformative, but has left many practical questions about how to utilize these approaches in a controllable and efficient manner. This talk explores this challenge of using probabilistic models to impose explicit modeling structure. I show that discrete structured models can now be implemented efficiently on modern hardware with optimizing compilers. These approaches generalize the standard softmax function we all know and love, and in fact are not much harder to use in practice. To show the benefit of this approach, I will describe a factorization of the Transformer into a structured model that lets us learn a fast and accurate parallel translation decoder. The system shows how to take advantage of efficient inference based on basic distributional properties, while maintaining the modeling benefits of a deep model.

We will show how this methodology can be used as building blocks for continuous monitoring and firewall systems for AI.

[Building Malleable ML Systems through Measurement, Monitoring & Maintenance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNkqAZ54wGo)

Abstract
Machine learning systems are now easier to build than ever, but they still don’t perform as well as we would hope on real applications. I’ll explore a simple idea in this talk: if ML systems were more malleable and could be maintained like software, we might build better systems. I’ll discuss an immediate bottleneck towards building more malleable ML systems: the evaluation pipeline. I’ll describe the need for finer-grained performance measurement and monitoring, the opportunities paying attention to this area could open up in maintaining ML systems, and some of the tools that I’m building (with great collaborators) in the Robustness Gym project to close this gap.




**Bio:** Karan Goel is a 3rd year CS PhD student at Stanford advised by Chris Ré. His main goal is to accelerate the pace at which machine learning can be robustly and safely used in practice across applications, and in industry at large. He leads the Robustness Gym project, where he builds tools to measure, monitor and repair machine learning systems interactively. He is a recipient of the Siebel Foundation Scholarship.

[Assorted boring problems in distributed machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7N3quJcGNQ)

Abstract
Much of the academic focus on “distributing/scaling up machine learning” is synonymous with “training larger supervised ML models like GPT-3 with more and more compute resources”. However, training is only a small part of the ML lifecycle. In this talk, I’ll focus on a couple other machine learning problems that demand a large amount of compute resources, which may be a bit more “boring” but equally (or arguably more!) important. I’ll cover a couple problems that my collaborators and I have previously worked on at UC Berkeley and now at Anyscale: abstractions for scalable reinforcement learning and building RLlib (ICML 18, ICLR 20), distributed hyperparameter tuning and dynamic resource allocation for hyperparameter tuning (SOCC 19, Eurosys 21), and ray as a substrate for the next generation of ML platforms.




**Bio:** Richard Liaw is an engineer at Anyscale, where he leads a team in building open source machine learning libraries on top of Ray. He is on leave from the PhD program at UC Berkeley, where he worked at the RISELab advised by Ion Stoica, Joseph Gonzalez, and Ken Goldberg. In his time in the PhD program, he was part of the Ray team, building scalable ML libraries on top of Ray.

[Deep Learning Based Recommender Systems in Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPso35VkuCs)

Abstract
Recommender Systems are one of the most complex ML applications to deploy into production. The data is sparse, massive, and constantly increasing, and the models deployed create a feedback loop that requires careful monitoring. What's more, the hardware and software that led to the revolution of deep learning was built during the era of computer vision. Differences in architecture and data between vision and recommenders initially made the HW/SW stack a poor fit for deep learning based recommender systems. In this talk we'll explore what makes recommenders different from a data, architecture, and system perspective, and talk about changes in GPU hardware within the last generation that make it much better suited to the recommendation problem. By focusing on these differences we've also identified improvements on the software side that take advantage of optimizations only possible in the recommendation domain. A new era of faster ETL, Training and Inference is coming to the RecSys space and this talk will walk through some of the patterns of optimization that guide the tools we're building to make recommenders both faster to use and easier to deploy on GPUs.




**Bio:** Even Oldridge is a Sr. Manager at NVIDIA leading the effort to develop the open source libraries of Merlin which provide fast, easy to use and deploy, scalable recommender systems on the GPU. He has a PhD in Computer Vision and a Masters in Programmable Hardware from the University of British Columbia. He’s worked in the recommendation space for the past decade and has developed systems for recommending dates and houses, among other things. He’s an industry co-chair for ACM RecSys Conference 2021, and he’ll talk your ear off about embeddings and deep learning based recommenders if you let him.

[Towards Instance-Optimized Data Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOXen4elWns)

Abstract
Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around ML-enhanced (or learned) algorithm and data structures. For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, sketches, among many other things. Arguably, the motivation behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, what these techniques will allow us to build are “instance-optimized” systems; systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance and avoid the need for tuning by an administrator. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the opportunities and limitations of learned index structures, storage layouts, and query optimization techniques we have been developing in my group, and how we are integrating these techniques to build a first instance-optimized database system.




**Bio:** Tim Kraska is an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, co-director of the Data System and AI Lab at MIT (DSAIL@CSAIL), and co-founder of Einblick Analytics.

[Disruptive Research on Distributed ML Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKRrrfPgng)

Abstract
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enable computers to excel across many different applications such as image classification, speech recognition and robotics control. To accelerate DNN training and serving, parallel computing is widely adopted. System efficiency is a big issue when scaling out. In this talk, I will make three arguments towards better system efficiency in distributed DNN training and serving.
First, Ring All-Reduce for model synchronization is not optimal, but Blink is. By packing spanning trees rather than forming rings, Blink achieves higher flexibility in arbitrary networking environments and provides near-optimal network throughput. Blink is filed as a US patent and is being used by Microsoft. Blink gains lots of attention from industry, such as Facebook (distributed PyTorch team), ByteDance (parent company of TikTok app). Blink was also featured on Nvidia GTC China 2019 and news from Baidu, Tencent.
Second, communication can be eliminated via sensAI's class parallelism. sensAI decouples a multi-task model into disconnected subnets, each is responsible for decision making of a single task. sensAI's attribute of low-latency, real-time model serving attracts several Venture Capitals in the Bay Area.
Third, Wavelet is more efficient than gang-scheduling. By intentionally adding task launching latency, Wavelet interleaves peak memory usage across different waves of training tasks on the accelerators, and thus it improves both computation and on-device memory utilization. Multiple companies, including Facebook and Apple, show interests to Wavelet project.




**Bio:** Guanhua Wang is a final year CS PhD in the RISELab at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Ion Stoica. His research lies primarily in the ML+Systems area including fast collective communication schemes for model synchronization, efficient in-parallel model training and real-time model serving.

Abstract
The past decade has witnessed a 300,000 times increase in the amount of compute for AI. The latest natural language processing model is fueled with over trillion parameters while the memory need of neural recommendation and ranking models has grown from hundreds of gigabyte to the terabyte scale. This talk introduces the underinvested deep learning personalization and recommendation systems in the overall research community. The training of state-of-the-art industry-scale personalization and recommendation models consumes the highest number of compute cycles among all deep learning use cases at Facebook. For AI inference, recommendation use cases consume even higher compute cycles of 80%. What are the key system challenges faced by industry-scale neural personalization and recommendation models? This talk will highlight recent advances on AI system development for deep learning recommendation and the implications on infrastructure optimization opportunities across the machine learning system stack. System research for deep learning recommendation and AI at large is at a nascent stage. This talk will conclude with research directions for building and designing responsible AI systems – that is fair, efficient, and environmentally sustainable.

Abstract
The focus of this presentation is the scalable and distributed machine learning platform, H2O. The multi-node distributed algorithms (GLM, Random Forest, GBM, DNNs, etc) can train on datasets which are larger than RAM (of a single machine), and H2O integrates with other 'big data' systems, Hadoop and Spark. H2O is engineered for production use cases with a focus on fast training and prediction speeds. The second part of the talk will discuss a systems approach to developing novel machine learning algorithms such as H2O AutoML. Unlike well-defined ML algorithms (e.g. GBM), an 'AutoML' algorithm is an automated process which aims to train the best model (or ensemble) in a specified amount of time. I will discuss our methodology for experimentation and validation of new strategies or changes to the algorithm, using a benchmark-driven systems approach.

[Building Decentralized Neural Search Systems in Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WniuYVHqL80)

Abstract
With the rapid growth of media and meta data in both the enterprise and consumer markets, there is an evolving need for search systems to go beyond simple symbolic retrieval and towards more cognitive-driven understanding. Today, with the ever more long documents and multimedia data, finding the right information is more important and challenging than ever. The rise of deep learning has ushered in a new era of neural search. However, building a neural search system is non-trivial for researchers and engineers. While neural search has long held a significant promise, the advantages of open source combined with recent advances in deep learning now provides us a framework to make the next generation of search technology a reality.
In this talk, I will describe how Jina solves these challenges by providing an open source neural search ecosystem for businesses and developers, allowing anyone to search any kind of data with high availability and scalability - driving the shift from a traditional search system to a state-of-the-art AI-centric search system.

[NoisePage: The Self-Driving Database Management System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY1c7qqQeuA)

Abstract
Database management systems (DBMSs) are an important part of modern data-driven applications. However, they are notoriously difficult to deploy and administer. There are existing methods that recommend physical design or knob configurations for DBMSs. But most of them require humans to make final decisions and decide when to apply changes. The goal of a self-driving DBMS is to remove the DBMS administration impediments by managing itself autonomously. In this talk, I present the design of a new self-driving DBMS (NoisePage) that enables such automatic system management. I first discuss a forecasting framework that uses unsupervised clustering and ensemble ML models to efficiently predict the query arrival rates under varying database workload patterns. I then describe NoisePage's modeling framework that constructs and maintains ML models to predict the behavior of self-driving DBMS actions: the framework decomposes the DBMS architecture into fine-grained operating units to estimate the system's behavior under unseen configurations. I then introduce our ongoing work for an action planning framework that makes explainable decisions based on the forecasted workload and the modeled behavior. Lastly, I explain how we integrate all the self-driving components into the system.




**Bio:** Lin Ma (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~malin199/) is a PhD candidate from Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department advised by Andy Pavlo.

[Automating Architecture Transfer on Diverse Tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovpo0BdmNT4)

Abstract
Hand-crafted neural architecture design has played a major role in accelerating progress in computer vision, resulting in effective backbones like ResNet. Unfortunately, these convolutional backbones are not as effective in other domains. Successfully transferring existing architectures to applications such as sequence modeling, learning on graphs, or solving partial differential equations has required the manual design of task-specific neural operations to replace convolutions. In this talk, we will first motivate the problem of 'automating architecture transfer' to enable users to find the right operations given data from their specific domain. We will next present our ongoing work on this problem, by introducing a family of neural operations called 'XD-Operations' that mimic the inductive bias of multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive, provably containing numerous well-known operations. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of XD-operations on a diverse set of applications---in some cases outperforming the latest neural operation designs.

Abstract
Data Science usage at Netflix goes much beyond our eponymous recommendation systems. It touches almost all aspects of our business - from optimizing content delivery and informing buying decisions to fighting fraud. Our unique culture affords our data scientists extraordinary freedom of choice in ML tools and libraries, all of which results in an ever-expanding set of interesting problem statements and a diverse set of ML approaches to tackle them. Our data scientists, at the same time, are expected to build, deploy, and operate complex ML workloads autonomously without the need to be significantly experienced with systems or data engineering. In this talk, I will discuss some of the challenges involved in improving the development and deployment experience for ML workloads. I will focus on Metaflow, our ML framework, which offers useful abstractions for managing the model’s lifecycle end-to-end, and how a focus on human-centric design positively affects our data scientists' velocity.

Abstract
In this talk, I will describe a reinforcement learning (RL) method for chip floorplanning, the engineering problem of designing the physical layout of a computer chip. Chip floorplanning ordinarily requires weeks or months of effort by physical design engineers to produce manufacturable layouts. Our method generates floorplans in under six hours that are superior or comparable to humans in all key metrics, including power consumption, performance, and chip area. To achieve this, we pose chip floorplanning as a reinforcement learning problem, and develop a novel edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferrable representations of the chip. Our method was used in the design of the next generation of Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators (TPU).

Abstract
Deep neural networks are pushing the state of the art in numerous machine learning research domains; from computer vision, to natural language processing, and even tabular business data. However, scaling such models to train efficiently on large datasets imposes a unique set of challenges that traditional batch data processing systems were not designed to solve. Horovod is an open source framework that scales models written in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet to train seamlessly on hundreds of GPUs in parallel. In this talk, we'll explain the concepts and unique constraints that led to the development of Horovod at Uber, and discuss how the latest trends in deep learning research are informing the future direction of the project within the Linux Foundation. We'll explore how Horovod fits into production ML workflows in industry, and how tools like Spark and Ray can combine with Horovod to make productionizing deep learning at scale on remote data centers as simple as running locally on your laptop. Finally, we'll share some thoughts on what's next for large scale deep learning, including new distributed training architectures and how the larger ecosystem of production ML tooling is evolving.

Abstract
My students and I often find ourselves as "subject matter experts" needing to create video understanding models that serve computer graphics and video analysis applications. Unfortunately, like many, we are frustrated by how a smart grad student, armed with a large \*unlabeled\* video collection, an palette of pre-trained models, and an idea of what novel object or activity they want to detect/segment/classify, requires days-to-weeks to create and validate a model for their task. In this talk I will discuss challenges we've faced in the iterative process of curating data, training models, and validating models for the specific case of rare events and categories in image and video collections. In this regime we've found that conventional wisdom about training on imbalance data sets, and data acquisition via active learning does not lead to the most efficient solutions. I'll discuss these challenges in the context of image and video analysis applications, and elaborate on our ongoing vision of how a grad student, armed with massive amounts of unlabeled video data, pretrained models, and available-in-seconds-supercomputing-scale elastic compute should be able to interactively iterate on cycles of acquiring training data, training models, and validating models.

[Scalable Bayesian Optimization for Industrial Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpTxayP4CIU)

Abstract
Bayesian optimization has become a powerful method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. These functions do not have a closed-form and are evaluated for example by running a complex economic simulation, by an experiment in the lab or in a market, or by a CFD simulation. Use cases arise in machine learning, e.g., when tuning the configuration of an ML model or when optimizing a reinforcement learning policy. Examples in engineering include the design of aerodynamic structures or materials discovery. In this talk I will introduce the key ideas of Bayesian optimization and discuss how they can be applied to tuning ML models. Moreover, I will share some experiences with developing a Bayesian optimization service in industry.




**Bio:** Matthias’ research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and optimization, with a focus on Bayesian methods for 'exotic' optimization problems arising in business applications and in the natural sciences. He is a Principled Scientist at Amazon.

[JAX: accelerating machine learning research by composing function transformations in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbUwCPiqZBM)

Abstract
JAX is a system for high-performance machine learning research and numerical computing. It offers the familiarity of Python+NumPy together with hardware acceleration, plus a set of composable function transformations: automatic differentiation, automatic batching, end-to-end compilation (via XLA), parallelizing over multiple accelerators, and more. JAX's core strength is its guarantee that these user-wielded transformations can be composed arbitrarily, so that programmers can write math (e.g. a loss function) and transform it into pieces of an ML program (e.g. a vectorized, compiled, batch gradient function for that loss).
JAX had its open-source release in December 2018 (https://github.com/google/jax). It's used by researchers for a wide range of applications, from studying training dynamics of neural networks, to probabilistic programming, to scientific applications in physics and biology.




**Bio:** Roy Frostig is a research scientist at Google.

[Principles of Good Machine Learning Systems Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_AUuTuPA5k)

Abstract
This talk covers what it means to operationalize ML models. It starts by analyzing the difference between ML in research vs. in production, ML systems vs. traditional software, as well as myths about ML production.
It then goes over the principles of good ML systems design and introduces an iterative framework for ML systems design, from scoping the project, data management, model development, deployment, maintenance, to business analysis. It covers the differences between DataOps, ML Engineering, MLOps, and data science, and where each fits into the framework. It also discusses the main skills each stage requires, which can help companies in structuring their teams.
The talk ends with a survey of the ML production ecosystem, the economics of open source, and open-core businesses.

[Programmatically Building & Managing Training Data with Snorkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDVV4zKNqIE)

Abstract
One of the key bottlenecks in building machine learning systems is creating and managing the massive training datasets that today's models require. In this talk, I will describe our work on Snorkel (snorkel.org), an open-source framework for building and managing training datasets, and describe three key operators for letting users build and manipulate training datasets: labeling functions, for labeling unlabeled data; transformation functions, for expressing data augmentation strategies; and slicing functions, for partitioning and structuring training datasets. These operators allow domain expert users to specify machine learning (ML) models entirely via noisy operators over training data, expressed as simple Python functions---or even via higher level NL or point-and-click interfaces---leading to applications that can be built in hours or days, rather than months or years, and that can be iteratively developed, modified, versioned, and audited. I will describe recent work on modeling the noise and imprecision inherent in these operators, and using these approaches to train ML models that solve real-world problems, including recent state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks and real-world industry, government, and medical deployments.

[On Heterogeneity in Federated Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laCyJICLyWg)

Abstract
A defining characteristic of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity, i.e., that data and compute may differ significantly across the network. In this talk I show that the challenge of heterogeneity pervades the machine learning process in federated settings, affecting issues such as optimization, modeling, and fairness. In terms of optimization, I discuss FedProx, a distributed optimization method that offers robustness to systems and statistical heterogeneity. I then explore the role that heterogeneity plays in delivering models that are accurate and fair to all users/devices in the network. Our work here extends classical ideas in multi-task learning and alpha-fairness to large-scale heterogeneous networks, enabling flexible, accurate, and fair federated learning.

[Machine Learning at Industrial Scale: Lessons from the MLflow Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQ9WqXPIS4)

Abstract
Although enterprise adoption of machine learning is still early on, many enterprises in all industries already have hundreds of internal ML applications. ML powers business processes with an impact of hundreds of millions of dollars in industrial IoT, finance, healthcare and retail. Building and operating these applications reliably requires infrastructure that is different from traditional software development, which has led to significant investment in the construction of “ML platforms” specifically designed to run ML applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the common challenges in productionizing ML applications based on experience building MLflow, an open source ML platform started at Databricks. MLflow is now the most widely used open source project in this area, with over 2 million downloads a month and integrations with dozens of other products. I’ll also highlight some interesting problems users face that are not covered deeply in current ML systems research, such as the need for “hands-free” ML that can train thousands of independent models without direct tuning from the ML developer for regulatory reasons, and the impact of privacy and interpretability regulations on ML. All my examples will be based on experience at large Databricks / MLflow customers.




**Bio:** Matei Zaharia is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and Chief Technologist at Databricks. He started the Apache Spark project during his PhD at UC Berkeley in 2009, and has worked broadly on other cluster computing and analytics software, including MLflow and Delta Lake. At Stanford, Matei is a co-PI of the DAWN Lab doing research on infrastructure for machine learning.

[Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqiTtdY58Ts)

Abstract
We will present CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology and tool for testing NLP models inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering.

We will show a lot of fun bugs we discovered with CheckList, both in commercial models (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) and research models (BERT, RoBERTA for sentiment analysis, QQP, SQuAD). We'll also present comparisons between CheckList and the status quo, in a case study at Microsoft and a user study with researchers and engineers. We show that CheckList is a really helpful process and tool for testing and finding bugs in NLP models, both for practitioners and researchers.
